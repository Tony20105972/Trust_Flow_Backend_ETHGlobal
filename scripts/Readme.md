# ðŸ›  CLI Utilities & Helper Scripts

This directory contains various command-line interface (CLI) utilities and helper scripts designed to assist with development, deployment, and demonstration tasks for the project.

**Note for ETHGlobal Hackathon Judges:**

For the hackathon demo, the primary interaction with the blockchain functionalities (such as contract deployment, function calls, and IPFS uploads) is driven through the **FastAPI backend and the frontend application**. These CLI scripts are primarily for internal development, testing, and future extension of the project.

**Planned future enhancements include:**

* **`deploy_contract.py`**: A script for deploying smart contracts to various networks.
* **`compile_contracts.py`**: A utility for compiling Solidity contracts and managing ABIs/bytecodes.
* **`call_functions.py`**: A tool for interacting with deployed smart contract functions.
* **`upload_ipfs_report.py`**: A script for uploading reports and data to IPFS.
* **`dao_demo.py`**: Scripts for demonstrating DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) proposals and voting.
* **`demo_runner.py`**: An automated script to run the entire project demonstration flow end-to-end.

For the live demonstration, please refer to the main application interface.
