âœ… Hackathon Submission Checklist
This checklist will help you ensure all necessary components are ready and key considerations are met before submitting your project for the ETHGlobal hackathon.

1. Project Setup & Code
[ ] Repository is Public: Confirmed your GitHub repository is set to public.

[ ] README.md (Root): A comprehensive README file is prepared, including a project overview, setup instructions, usage guidelines, and demo steps.

[ ] requirements.txt: All Python dependencies are accurately listed.

[ ] .env.example: Provides clear guidance on required environment variables without including sensitive values.

[ ] .gitignore: Confirmed that the .env file and other sensitive/build-related files are properly excluded from Git.

[ ] config/config.yaml: API keys and sensitive data are replaced with placeholder values (e.g., YOUR_API_KEY_HERE).

[ ] config/networks.json: Network configuration information is accurate.

[ ] Clean Code: Code is reasonably clean, commented where necessary, and follows good development practices.

[ ] Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented for critical paths.

2. Functionality & Demo
[ ] Core Features Implemented: All planned MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features are working (e.g., AI contract generation, deployment, function calls, IPFS uploads).

[ ] End-to-End Flow: The entire demo flow can be executed smoothly.

[ ] Live Demo Readiness:

[ ] The frontend connects correctly to the deployed backend.

[ ] All necessary API keys/private keys are correctly configured as environment variables in the deployment environment (e.g., Render/Fly.io).

[ ] No hardcoded sensitive information is present.

[ ] The demo is presentable via the UI, and potentially via CLI (e.g., if scripts/demo_runner.py is robust) as a backup.

[ ] Blockchain Interaction: Real transactions are sent to the target blockchain (testnet or mainnet).

[ ] IPFS Integration: Files are successfully uploaded to IPFS and are retrievable.

3. Documentation (docs/)
[ ] backend-architecture.png: A clear backend architecture diagram is drawn and uploaded.

[ ] api-endpoints.md: All major API endpoints are documented with request/response examples.

[ ] deployment-guide.md: Clear instructions for deploying the backend (e.g., to Render/Fly.io) are provided.

[ ] LICENSE: An appropriate open-source license file is included.

4. Presentation & Submission
[ ] Devpost Submission: All required fields on Devpost are filled out.

[ ] Video Submission: The demo video is clear, concise, and effectively showcases key features.

[ ] Team Members: All team members are correctly listed.

[ ] Project Title & Description: Clearly conveys the project's purpose and innovation.

[ ] Category Selection: Appropriate hackathon categories are selected.

[ ] Bounty Submissions: Requirements for any claimed bounties are met and clearly linked/explained.
